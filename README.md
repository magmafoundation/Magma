## About

Magma is the next generation of hybrid minecraft server softwares.

Magma is based on Forge and Paper, meaning it can run both Craftbukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins and Forge mods.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Magma experience with support for newer 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.

## Big Paper Update :fireworks:

Magma at the moment ain't using all of the API/Patches with this update we will have all features of Paper and more optimizations and including Timings v2

We can't wait to have this finished and shared with all for a better/faster server software

We have Dev Build channel in the discord for this update so you can come and test it out and find bugs for us to fix before release

All work is being done on the [feature/full-paper-support](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma/tree/feature/full-paper-support) branch if you would like to check it out

## Deployment

### Installation

1. Download the recommended builds from the [**Releases** section](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma/releases) (Don't use the "-installer" version, it's broken right now)

2. Make a new directory for the server
3. Move the jar that you previously downloaded to the new directory
4. Run the jar with cmd, going to your directory and entering `java -jar Magma-[version here]-server.jar`. Change [version-here] to your Magma version number.
