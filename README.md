### What's Magma?

Magma next  generation in hybrid servers.

Magma is based on Forge and Paper builds, meaning it can run both Craftbukkit/Spigot/Paper-based plugins and forge-based mods.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Magma experience with support for new 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.

### 1.14+ Info

Magma will be swaping from craftbukkit to a custom made bukkit/spigot/paper implementation to make it easier to update and make compatibility with mods and plugins better overall.

This update will take some time as we are rewriting a lot of the underlying code
